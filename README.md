## Description

The React TriviaQuest Challenge is an interactive quiz application developed using React. This quiz consists of a wide range of general knowledge questions, organized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and high. Users can test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions that gradually increase in complexity.

The quiz imposes a time limit of 30 seconds for each question. If a user fails to select an answer within the given time frame, the application automatically proceeds to the next question. At the end of the quiz, users receive their score and have the option to start a new round with fresh questions.
